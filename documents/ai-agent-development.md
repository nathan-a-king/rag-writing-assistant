# AI Agent Development Guide

## Introduction to AI Agents

AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of modern AI development, agents typically combine large language models (LLMs) with tools and memory systems.

## Core Components

### 1. Language Model

The brain of the agent - typically a large language model like GPT-4, Claude, or open-source alternatives:

- Processes natural language input
- Generates responses and decisions
- Determines which tools to use
- Maintains conversation context

### 2. Tools

Functions that the agent can call to interact with external systems:

- API calls (web search, databases, etc.)
- File operations (read, write, process)
- Computational tools (calculators, data analysis)
- Integration with external services

Example tool definition:
```typescript
const searchTool = {
  name: 'web_search',
  description: 'Search the web for information',
  parameters: {
    query: 'string'
  },
  execute: async (query: string) => {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### 3. Memory

Systems for storing and retrieving information:

- **Short-term memory**: Conversation history within a session
- **Long-term memory**: Persistent storage across sessions
- **Vector memory**: Semantic search over past interactions
- **Entity memory**: Tracking of specific entities (users, projects, etc.)

### 4. Planning

The ability to break down complex tasks into steps:

- Goal decomposition
- Task prioritization
- Sequential execution
- Error handling and replanning

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct Pattern

Reason + Act: The agent alternates between reasoning and taking actions.

```
Thought: I need to find information about X
Action: search("X")
Observation: [search results]
Thought: Based on the results, I should...
Action: [next action]
```

### Chain-of-Thought

Breaking down reasoning into explicit steps:

```
Step 1: Understand the question
Step 2: Identify what information is needed
Step 3: Retrieve relevant information
Step 4: Synthesize and provide answer
```

### Multi-Agent Systems

Multiple specialized agents working together:

- **Researcher Agent**: Gathers information
- **Analyst Agent**: Processes and analyzes data
- **Writer Agent**: Generates written content
- **Critic Agent**: Reviews and provides feedback

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Combining LLMs with information retrieval:

### Components

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Load documents
   - Chunk into manageable pieces
   - Generate embeddings
   - Store in vector database

2. **Query Processing**
   - Convert user query to embedding
   - Retrieve relevant chunks
   - Rank by similarity

3. **Response Generation**
   - Provide retrieved context to LLM
   - Generate response based on context
   - Cite sources when applicable

### Embedding Models

Popular choices for converting text to vectors:

- OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
- Voyage AI voyage-3-large
- Cohere embed-v3
- Open-source alternatives (sentence-transformers)

### Vector Databases

Storage systems optimized for similarity search:

- Pinecone (managed service)
- Chroma (embedded database)
- Qdrant (open-source)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering

- Be clear and specific in instructions
- Provide examples when possible
- Set appropriate temperature and parameters
- Use system messages to define agent behavior

### Tool Design

- Keep tools focused and single-purpose
- Provide clear descriptions and schemas
- Handle errors gracefully
- Log tool usage for debugging

### Error Handling

- Validate inputs before processing
- Provide informative error messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Fallback strategies when tools fail

### Monitoring and Observability

- Log all agent interactions
- Track tool usage and performance
- Monitor LLM costs
- Measure task success rates

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

- Sanitize user inputs
- Prevent prompt injection attacks
- Validate tool parameters

### Access Control

- Limit agent permissions
- Use API keys securely
- Implement rate limiting
- Audit agent actions

### Data Privacy

- Don't store sensitive information unnecessarily
- Implement data retention policies
- Comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Tests

Test individual components:
- Tool execution
- Memory operations
- Prompt templates

### Integration Tests

Test agent workflows:
- Multi-step tasks
- Tool chaining
- Error recovery

### Evaluation

Measure agent performance:
- Task completion rate
- Response quality
- Latency and costs
- User satisfaction

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-complicated prompts**: Keep instructions clear and concise
2. **Tool overload**: Too many tools can confuse the agent
3. **Insufficient context**: Provide enough information for decision-making
4. **Poor error handling**: Always account for failures
5. **Ignoring costs**: Monitor and optimize LLM usage
